biochar_market
==============

Setting up a digital biochar marketplace. Getting people out to do some carbon dating by:

-Show basics of biochar production.

-Show how/where/why to use biochar.

-Set up an exchange to match peoople w/ biochar w/ people who want it.

We've yet to get much of anything online yet but if you'd like to get involved e-mail:
-amanda@350.org

Map of Biochar supportive countries in .png format. Needs to have the following put into a legend, I was thinking just a
text box over Russia or thereabouts. 


All of the countries which have made submissions to the UNFCCC seeking
the inclusion of Biochar as a high potential climate mitigation and
adaptation tool in a post Kyoto agreement are colored green and are
labeled.

See http://www.biochar-international.org/policy/international


An idea for a cool geo visualisation would be to take the pH biochar data and match it to soil types which are already
available.  See UC Davis biochar research for pH info and other resources.

There are many soil experts out there and I'm not one of em' so I gotta look into it. The Climate Corporation might be a 
good place to start.
